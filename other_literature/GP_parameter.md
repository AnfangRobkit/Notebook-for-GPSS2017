## GP Parameter

- Amplitude ($\sigma$) controls the scaling of the output along the y-axis. This parameter is just a scalar multiplier, and is therefore usually left out of implementations of the Mat√®rn function (i.e. set to one). Amplitude is an included parameter (variance), so we do not need to include a separate constant kernel.
  
- lengthscale ($l$) complements the amplitude by scaling realizations on the x-axis. Larger values push points closer together along this axis.

- roughness ($\nu$) controls the sharpness of ridges in the covariance function, which ultimately affect the roughness (smoothness) of realizations. In $GPy$, there are two subclasses: one which fixes the roughness parameter to 3/2 ($Matern32$) and another to 5/2 ($Matern52$).
