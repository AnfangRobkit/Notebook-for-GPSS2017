### Stochastic Process
a stochastic process is a collection of random variable indexed by some variable $x \in \mathcal{X}$.
$$f = \begin{Bmatrix} f(x):x \in \mathcal{X} \end{Bmatrix}$$
$f$ can be thought of as a function of location $x$.

$f$ is an infinite dimensional process. However, thankfully we only need consider the finite dimensional distributions (FDDs), i.e., for all $x_1, . . . x_n$ and for all $n ∈ N$ $
P(f (x_1) ≤ y_1, . . . , f (x_n) ≤ y_n)$
as these uniquely determine the law of f .

A Gaussian process is a stochastic process with Gaussian FDDs, i.e.
$$(f(x_1)...f(x_n))\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\varSigma)$$
### Import properties
- Property 1: $x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\varSigma)$ if and only if $AX \sim \mathcal{N_p}(A\mu,A\varSigma A^T)$
So, sum of Gaussian is Gaussian (taking $A$ as ones vector), and marginal distributions of multivariate are still Gaussian. (taking $A$ is a vector with [0 0 0 1])
- Property 2: Conditional distributions are still Gaussian.

Suppose: 
$$X = \begin{pmatrix}
X_1
\\ 
X_2
\end{pmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\varSigma)$$
where,
$$\mu = \begin{pmatrix}
\mu_1\\ 
\mu_2
\end{pmatrix}$$
$$\varSigma =\begin{pmatrix}
\varSigma_{11} &\varSigma_{12} \\ 
\varSigma_{21} &\varSigma_{22}
\end{pmatrix} $$
